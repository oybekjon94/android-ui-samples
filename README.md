## UI Elements
A View is an object that draws something on the screen that the user can interact with and a ViewGroup is an object that holds other View (and ViewGroup) objects in order to define the layout of the user interface.

### Android UI Controls
There are number of UI controls provided by Android that allow you to build the graphical user interface for your app.

### 1	TextView
This control is used to display text to the user.

### 2	EditText
EditText is a predefined subclass of TextView that includes rich editing capabilities.

### 3	AutoCompleteTextView
The AutoCompleteTextView is a view that is similar to EditText, except that it shows a list of completion suggestions automatically while the user is typing.

### 4	Button
A push-button that can be pressed, or clicked, by the user to perform an action.

### 5	ImageButton
An ImageButton is an AbsoluteLayout which enables you to specify the exact location of its children. This shows a button with an image (instead of text) that can be pressed or clicked by the user.

### 6	CheckBox
An on/off switch that can be toggled by the user. You should use check box when presenting users with a group of selectable options that are not mutually exclusive.

### 7	ToggleButton
An on/off button with a light indicator.

### 8	RadioButton
The RadioButton has two states: either checked or unchecked.

### 9	RadioGroup
A RadioGroup is used to group together one or more RadioButtons.

### 10	ProgressBar
The ProgressBar view provides visual feedback about some ongoing tasks, such as when you are performing a task in the background.

### 11	Spinner
A drop-down list that allows users to select one value from a set.

### 12	TimePicker
The TimePicker view enables users to select a time of the day, in either 24-hour mode or AM/PM mode.

### 13	DatePicker
The DatePicker view enables users to select a date of the day.
